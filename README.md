# AB_Testing_Ecommerce_Analysis

 Ecommerce_AB_Testing_Project  

*Business Analyst / ICT Portfolio Case Study (2024â€“2025)*  
Simulated an A/B test on ~294k user sessions to evaluate whether a redesigned landing page (Variant B) outperformed the existing design (Variant A).  

Result: *Variant B did not outperform Variant A*. Conversion was nearly identical (A = 12.04%, B = 11.89%), with both Z-test (p=0.893) and Chi-Square (p=0.216) confirming no statistical significance.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- *Objective:* Evaluate a landing page redesign using controlled A/B testing.  
- *Dataset:* ~294k sessions, balanced 50/50 across groups.  
- *Methodology:* Data validation, cleaning/deduplication, hypothesis framing, Z-test, Chi-Square, funnel diagnostics, and dashboarding.  
- *Role Demonstrated:* Business Analyst / ICT professional aligning *statistics â†’ insights â†’ business storytelling*.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- *Conversion Rates:* A = *12.04%, B = **11.89%* (gap = -0.15pp).  
- *Statistical Tests:* No evidence B is better (Z-test p=0.893, Chi-Square p=0.216).  
- *Funnel Analysis:* Nearly identical performance; redesign added no uplift.  
- *Business Decision:* *Keep Variant A*; Variant B adds cost/risk without ROI.
